            <p>Here we are. The here and now.  Only having access to Netflix and Hulu for the first half of my life introduced me to so many amazing shows. Fx’s “Atlanta”, which I’d been waiting 3 years for, dropped 2 seasons including its final last year. The social-commentary of that show was groundbreaking, and it wrapped up with one of the most beautiful finales I’d ever seen. It seemed like my taste had been secular to those two apps before coming here. These college years have truly been defined by my access to streaming services. New friends for me means new passwords. I had plenty of fresh content to run through. The most important acquisition of all BY FAR was access to HBO. I’d lived my entire life having never seen a second of an HBO original. My world was changed, and I spent the next two years digesting HBO shows. From heavy hitters like Barry, Big Little Lies, How to With John Wilson, I had so much fun watching with friends and roommates. Two HBO originals immediately slunk into my top 5 shows of all time. Succession was a show I wanted to hate so badly for so many reasons, but it is really one of the most complicated and dramatic shows I've ever seen. But no show has ever drawn me in as quickly as the Sopranos. I became instantly obsessed with its Twin Peaks level ambiguity and commentary on television in America. The writers had the capacity to craft some of the most existential statements ever seen on screen, followed by perfectly natural scumbag banter. I have studied these shows front to back, and they have taught me volumes on how to captivate an audience.</p>
