            <p>Stepping into adolescence, things got real. I’m talking R-rated real. My brother showed me how we could access Comedy Central through the laptop, and by third grade I was quoting South Park at school. These were the years where I started really developing a taste. I wouldn’t watch just anything anymore, because there were a lot of things that I started to think were bad. The first show I ever watched up and down was Lost. It taught me alot about cycles of death and rebirth, and its the reason I found out how to rent from the library. Network TV  was stacked to the brim with amazing sitcoms nightly, with 30-Rock, the Office, How I Met Your Mother, Community, and Parks and Rec all on air at the same time. Two of the most influential films of my life debuted during this time. Watching the Dark Knight in theaters showed me that comic book movies can be more than banter and explosions, and is still one of my favorite movies today. Iron Man dropped the same year, and launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe which has grown at unfathomable rates since then. </p>
