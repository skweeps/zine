        <h2 class="title">EARLY CHILDHOOD</h2>
        <p>My early childhood was very influential because it taught me how much I had to learn through film and tv. Growing up I mainly watched educational tv shows via PBS. Shows like ‘Word Girl’, ‘Super-Why’, and ‘Sesame Street’ were a very useful precursor to Elementary School. I was always jealous of the kids with cable because they had Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. For me, I waited every week for Saturday morning so I could pour up my cereal and sit down for the cool cartoons. Shows like Bionacle and Yu-Gi-Oh gave me the energy I needed to get through each week. Although it’s hard to narrow down every movie I watched, the films I remember watching, I still consider them iconic to this day. Early memories consist of Indiana Jones, Spiderman, and arguably the most iconic of all, Star Wars. The most influential mediums from this era are the classic movies I’d watch with my Dad. He showed me all of Monty Python, Mel Brooks, and James Bond, which I will forever be indebted for.</p>
