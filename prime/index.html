        <p>High School was the highlight of my viewing days for many reasons. It was when I started really harnessing my knowledge for production. I followed the director's moves closely, and liked to know about a movie from the jump. I found I had so much to say but nobody to talk about it with. I decided to put pen to paper and make a small time movie reviewing account on Instagram, where I featured some of my favorite moments, scenes, and frames. Me and a longtime friend shared such a passion for films that we started a “Hollywood Club” at our school. And what a special time to do so. 2019 in my opinion is the greatest year for movies of all time. I was in the theater at least once a week, as bangers continued to drop. Parasite was a revelation, and opened my eyes to a world of foreign films that I’d previously left untouched. I paid close attention to the very tightly-contested Oscar race like I was watching the playoffs. Watching Parasite sweep the Oscars will always be one of the most cherished memories of my life.
            Some of my favorites of 2019 include Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Uncut Gems, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Midsommar, Lighthouse, the Farewell, and many many more.
