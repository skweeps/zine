        <h2 class="title">TWEEN</h2>
        <p>Enter the world of streaming. A portal at my fingertips. The dawn of Netflix marked a monumental change in my viewing career. I didn’t have to go to a library if I wanted to watch a show. I didn’t have to wait for weeks for a new episode to air. Stranger Things was maybe the second show I ever watched after Lost, and through some cursed chain of events, it somehow led me into Twin Peaks. With Twin Peaks being the second show I’d ever seen, it set a standard for TV like no other. I didn’t know what I was watching was so strange, because I had nothing to compare it to. I chased the emotions of Twin Peaks for years after finishing. It wasn’t til I was 13 years old that I first started watching Breaking Bad. ABQ taught me so much about storytelling and character arcs. It was even better being able to go straight into Better Call Saul as it was airing. This era was also when I started paying attention to what goes on behind the scenes. I started learning writers and directors names, and getting excited for who’s dropping when. It was this era where I watched most of the content I hold in the highest regard today.</p>
